It repairs bootloaders, runs failsafe diagnostics when Linux cannot boot, and provides a full GUI for CPU, RAM, storage, network, and GPIO tests with simple export options, including QR codes.\n\n\ud83c\udf4f Apple Pi Diagnostics\nA Complete All-In-One Hardware Diagnostic & Recovery Environment for Raspberry Pi\n\nApple Pi Diagnostics (APD) is a fully integrated, multi-stage diagnostic and recovery system designed to help users, makers, and technicians identify and fix Raspberry Pi hardware issues \u2014 even when the device cannot boot a normal operating system.\n\nAPD provides a reliable, user-friendly, and professional testing environment with a modern graphical interface, multiple export options, and support for every Raspberry Pi model.\n\n\u2b50 Key Features\nBootloader-Level Recovery\n\nAPD can detect and repair:\n\nCorrupt / missing EEPROM\n\nDamaged bootloaders\n\nIncorrect boot configuration\n\nUnreadable partitions\n\nThis stage runs before Linux even loads.\n\nFailsafe Framebuffer Mode\n\nIf the Pi cannot boot Linux, APD automatically launches into a minimal diagnostic mode that provides:\n\nBasic hardware probing\n\nSD card integrity checks\n\nPower/voltage validation\n\nClear error explanations\n\nGuidance to reach a full recovery\n\nNo desktop environment required.\n\nFull Linux Diagnostic Environment\n\nWhen the system can boot normally, APD loads a clean, modern GUI that supports:\n\nFull System Diagnostic Suite\n\nCPU stress & temperature testing\n\nRAM integrity testing\n\nSD card read/write benchmarking\n\nUSB, HDMI, and GPIO verification\n\nNetwork (Ethernet/Wi-Fi) diagnostics\n\nPower & voltage stability monitoring\n\nIndividual Test Selection\n\nRun only what you need:\n\nCPU test only\n\nNetwork test only\n\nSD card test only\n\netc.\n\nReport Export Options\n\nRAM Test\n--------\n\nThe project includes a programmable RAM diagnostic at `full-linux-gui/app/diagnostics/ram/ram_test.py`.\n\n- CLI usage:\n\n```bash\npython3 full-linux-gui/app/diagnostics/ram/ram_test.py --total-mb 128 --chunk-mb 16 --passes 1\n```\n\n- GUI:\n\t- Open the app `full-linux-gui/app/main.py`, click `Run Individual Tests` and enable `RAM Test`.\n\t- Choose `Total MB`, `Chunk MB`, and `Passes` before pressing `Run Selected`.\n\t- Live progress appears in the dialog log; results report `status`, `tested_mb`, and throughput (MB/s).\n\nNotes\n-----\n- The RAM test attempts to avoid allocating more than ~75% of available memory to reduce system instability. Adjust `Total MB` accordingly for thorough testing.\n- The test writes a deterministic pattern to each buffer and verifies it on readback. Any mismatch is reported as `FAIL` in the result.\n\nAfter a diagnostic session, users can save results using any of these built-in methods:\n\nSave to USB Drive\n\nSave to SD Card (Boot Partition)\n\nView Report On Screen\n\nGenerate a QR Code\n\nScan with a phone\n\nView report instantly\n\nNo internet required\n\n\ud83e\udde9 Designed for All Users\n\nApple Pi Diagnostics is built for:\n\nRaspberry Pi beginners\n\nRepair technicians\n\nMakers and educators\n\nBusinesses shipping Pi-based products\n\nAnyone who needs reliable Pi hardware verification\n\nNo technical experience required \u2014 the software automates everything from bootloader repair to report generation.\n\n\ud83d\udee0 How It Works (Three-Stage Architecture)\nStage 1 \u2014 Bootloader Recovery\n\nRepairs critical boot components automatically.\n\nStage 2 \u2014 Failsafe Mode\n\nLightweight framebuffer UI that works even when Linux can't boot.\n\nStage 3 \u2014 Full Diagnostics GUI\n\nA polished desktop environment powered by Python.\n\n\ud83d\udce6 Included Utilities\n\nBootloader repair tools\n\nSD card health checker\n\nEEPROM validator\n\nLive system monitor\n\nLog analyzer\n\nNetwork tools\n\nHardware abstraction utilities\n\nQR code generation module\n\nOne-click export functions\n\n\ud83d\udcc1 Project Structure Overview\n\nOrganized into:\n\nbootloader_stage/\n\nfailsafe_stage/\n\nlinux_stage/\n\ndesktop_app/\n\npi_imager/\n\nbuild_tools/\n\ndocs/\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Why Apple Pi Diagnostics?\n\nBecause troubleshooting Raspberry Pi hardware should be simple, reliable, and accessible to everyone, not a guessing game involving LEDs, config files, and multiple SD cards.\n\nAPD provides a single download that covers:\n\nBoot issues\n\nOS issues\n\nHardware issues\n\nUser-level diagnostics\n\nTechnician-level reporting\n\nAll in one clean, cohesive environment."
