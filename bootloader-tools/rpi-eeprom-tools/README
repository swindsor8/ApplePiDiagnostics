Apple Pi Diagnostics - rpi-eeprom-tools

to perform bootloader recovery via the recovery partition approach.

Required files (place them here manually after download):
  - pieeprom.bin
  - recovery.bin
  - bootconf.txt
  - recovery.conf

Do NOT place files you don't trust here. Only use official files from the Raspberry Pi Foundation.
